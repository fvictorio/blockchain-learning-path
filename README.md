# Blockchain Learning Path

An opinionated learning path for getting into speed with Blockchain (specially Ethereum). This is a
work in progress, please open an issue or send a pull request to help improving it.

## Pre-requisites

Besides a programming background, this path assumes that the reader is at least a little comfortable
with:

- Public key cryptography
- Digital signatures
- Cryptographic hashing

## Best Practices
- [Consensys best practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/) - This document provides a baseline knowledge of security considerations for intermediate Solidity programmers. It is maintained by ConsenSys Diligence, and the broader Ethereum community.
- [Solidity Patterns](https://github.com/fravoll/solidity-patterns) - A compilation of patterns and best practices.

## Libraries
- [dapp-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin) - Ethereum repo providing implementations for many common data structures and utilities in Solidity, Serpent and LLL.
- [Solidity Collections](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Collections) - Collections of code snippets and utility libraries.
- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) - Framework to build secure smart contracts.

## Examples
- [Solidity By Example](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html) - Contract examples from the official docs.

## Toolbox
List of tools curated by Protofire team to better apply best practices to the Protocol and DApps development projects.

#### General
- [eth-cli](https://github.com/protofire/eth-cli) - CLI tools.
- [REPL](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-repl) - Solidity REPL.
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Online realtime compiler and runtime.

#### Audit
- [SmartCheck](https://tool.smartdec.net) - Online tool for checking smart contracts for vulnerabilities and bad practices.

#### Utility
- [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) - Solidity linter that provides security, style guide and best practice rules for smart contract validation.
- [solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium) - Linter to identify and fix style & security issues in Solidity smart contracts.
